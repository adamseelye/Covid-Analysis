# Project 2

Group: VICTORIOUS

Project 2 is an analysis of COVID data using Spark.

We will be making queries of the data to better
understand the effects of COVID-19 on certain 
populations and to find any trends among the data.


To be VICTORIOUS, we set these goals:

To reach Minimum Viable Product:

-A package will be published on GitHub.com/adamseelye/Project_2

-Create a deliverable .jar file
-10 data queries: each displayed as a graph
-present any trends
-Spark logging
-Use Tableau for data visualization/analytics (graphs)


Stretch Goals:

-3D graphs
-complex data modeling
-s3 bucketing
