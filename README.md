# Project 2

##Group: VICTORIOUS

**Project 2 is an analysis of COVID data using Spark.

We will be making queries of the data to better
understand the effects of COVID-19 on certain 
populations and to find any trends among the data.**


##To be VICTORIOUS, we set these goals:

To reach Minimum Viable Product:

A package will be published on GitHub.com/adamseelye/Project_2
Use HDFS/Spark to process and model COVID data
Create a deliverable .jar file
10 data queries: each displayed as a graph
present any trends
Spark logging
Use Tableau for data visualization/analytics (graphs)
